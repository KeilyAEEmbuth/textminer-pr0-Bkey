Tim Walz, who called the attack a “politically motivated assassination,” said state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed, and State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot multiple times and wounded in in Brooklyn Park and Champlin, two neighboring suburban cities 10 to 20 miles outside Minneapolis. Boelter is also listed on a website of a company called Praetorian Guard Security Services, which lists him as director of security patrols. Who were the victims of the shootings in Minnesota?
